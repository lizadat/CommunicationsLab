# Great work!
* I worked with Adobe Photoshop for a very long time but never knew that there is an option of creating gifs. That's why I wanted to try and my result can be found on the website.
* What I found though disappointing: when I want to create a gif with layers, when I just choose the positions for the object with changing the timegframe, it is not possible to change the size or position (rotation). That is why for my gif I used the animated gif with only chaging the layers completely.
* I also was inspired by the laughing emoji that I used, so I decided to create my own in Adobe Illustrator. I really enjoy working in this program and really like vectored graphic.
* In the end I put all my works on the website.
